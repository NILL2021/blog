# So,

I was recently asked by @IGABMS on my rendering engine project, "How are triangles the easiest shapes for computers to generate? Wouldn't it be a square, then a rectangle? Aren't squares (pixels) the base of all computer graphics?"
Researching about the answer to this inspired me to learn graphics programming and get the answers. I started with a C# tutorial on Open TK
To learn a bit about the OpenGL graphics API. 

This post happens to be a work in progress.
